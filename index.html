    <h2>The purpose of this website</h2>
    <p>
      This was supposed to become my portfolio website, but then I realized that as an artist it would take way too long to make this look great with my programming skills.
      I might turn this into a portfolio website someday if I feel like it, but for now, this is my memesite that I had to create for a school project.
