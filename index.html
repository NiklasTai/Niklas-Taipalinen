    <h2>The purpose of this website</h2>
    <p>
      This was supposed to become my portfolio website, but then I realized that as an artist it would take way too long to make this look great with my programming skills.
      I might turn this into a portfolio website someday if I feel like it, but for now, this is my memesite that I had to create for a school project.

    <h2> My D&D characters </h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Aust</b></dt>
      <dd>Half elf paladin worshipping the Silver Flame. On a quest to purge the evil and protect the innocent while making them look good.
            Aust has funded a fashion workshop Holy Fashion where he usually helps when he's not on the battlefield.
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Aust (Alternative timeline)</b></dt>
      <dd>One day Aust and the rest of his team got an invitation to a free vacation.
          On this timeline Aust is barely holding on to his sanity as well as his holy oath to protect others.
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Thokk</b></dt>
        <dd>Thokk is a half orc barbarian who excels at fighting and is always ready to fight everything that crosses his path.
            Because of this, Thokk is bad at just about everything that isn't related to fighting.
            Thokk likes to do a dramatic entry and is always the first to run into a fight disregarding stealth and defence.
