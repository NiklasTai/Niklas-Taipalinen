    <h2>The purpose of this website</h2>
    <p>
      This was supposed to become my portfolio website, but then I realized that as an artist it would take way too long to make this look great with my programming skills.
      <br>
      I might turn this into a portfolio website someday if I feel like it, but for now, this is my memesite that I had to create for a school project.

    <h2> My D&D characters </h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>  <b>Aust</b> </dt>
        <dd>Half elf paladin of the Silver Flame. </dd>
        <dd>Aust has funded a fashion workshop called Holy Fashion where he usually helps when he's not on the battlefield. </dd>
        <dd>He has taken an oath to help the innocent and purge the evil.</dd>
      
      <dt>  <b>Aust (Alternative timeline)</b>  </dt>
        <dd>One day Aust and the rest of his team got an invitation to a free vacation. </dd>
        <dd>On this timeline Aust is barely holding on to his sanity and oath. </dd>
      
      <dt>  <b>Thokk</b>  </dt>
        <dd>Thokk is a half orc barbarian who excels at fighting and is always ready to fight everything that crosses his path. </dd>
        <dd>Thokk is always the first one to run into a fight disregarding stealth and defence. </dd>
        <dd>Because of this, Thokk is bad at just about everything that isn't related to fighting. </dd>
